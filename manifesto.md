The world is a mess. 
Everything is hard for no good fucking reason. 
If you look around, you see that we technically have everything we could ever want or at least the materials to build what's not already there. 
Recently I've realized many things, but one of the main ones is that we're operating our vessels without a proper instruction manual. Anyone who has tried to build a LEGO set or a piece of IKEA furniture knows that sometimes it really *does* pay to RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual). If a shelf needs a booklet with warnings, do's and don't's, a parts list and some assembly and usage diagrams, then how come we as human beings don't have anything resembling that? I guess the closest thing we do have is the *insert main text for your belief system here*, but that is like going to Hogwarts with only your Physics 101 book in hand. Don't get me wrong, I love physics, but the information is not entirely context appropriate.

So.

I figure it would be a waste not to at least attempt documenting the lessons that were learned, forgotten and re-learned many times. My memory has never been my strongest asset, so this is my attempt at getting down the basic template for lifes amazing and annoying quirks, processes, procedures and protocols.
