How-to-Human: git gud @life
The Manifesto
The world is a mess.
Everything is hard for no good fucking reason.
If you look around, you see that we technically have everything we could ever want or at least the materials to build what's not already there.
Recently I've realized many things, but one of the main ones is that we're operating our vessels without a proper instruction manual. Anyone who has tried to build a LEGO set or a piece of IKEA furniture knows that sometimes it really does pay to RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual). If a shelf needs a booklet with warnings, do's and don't's, a parts list and some assembly and usage diagrams, then how come we as human beings don't have anything resembling that? I guess the closest thing we do have is the insert main text for your belief system here, but that is like going to Hogwarts with only your Physics 101 book in hand. Don't get me wrong, I love physics, but the information is not entirely context appropriate.
At the same time I look around and see most adults act like kindergartners, and some kindergartners drop wisdom bombs that would go over the heads of states. So if nobody told you, I will: the mods are asleep at the wheel while getting head and sucking you dry at the same time.
So.
I figure it would be a waste not to at least attempt documenting the lessons that were learned, forgotten and re-learned many times. My memory has never been my strongest asset, so this is my attempt at getting down the basic template for lifes amazing and annoying quirks, processes, procedures and protocols.
Module 01: The Bootloader Sequence
A guide to getting the system online without immediate kernel panic.
Power On Sequence: The First 15 Minutes
System Check: Hydration. Before you do anything else—before coffee, before thoughts, before existential dread—drink a full glass of water. Your hardware has been running a background process called "keeping you alive" on zero intake for 6-8 hours. This is non-negotiable firmware maintenance.
Calibrate Sensors: Light. Find a window. Look out of it. Let actual photons from the giant fusion reactor in the sky hit your eyeballs for at least two minutes. This sets your internal system clock. Staring at the tiny, anxiety-inducing artificial sun in your hand (your phone) does not count. In fact, it probably corrupts the boot sector.
Run Diagnostics: Physical Movement. You don't need a full workout. Just confirm that all limbs are still attached and responsive to basic commands. Touch your toes. Stretch your arms to the ceiling. Do three pushups. Wiggle a bit. Get the coolant flowing.
Loading the OS (Operating Self)
AVOID KERNEL PANIC: The Social Media Trap. The single worst thing you can do for system stability is to check your phone first thing. It's like booting your system by plugging it directly into a malware-infested, public-facing network. You immediately start the day reacting to other people's bullshit, demands, and curated happiness instead of executing your own code. Don't do it.
Make a Definite Move (The main() Function). Inertia is the default state of the universe. A system at rest will stay at rest. The only counter-agent is a definite move. Before the day's background processes and random interrupts hijack your CPU, you must define your primary execution thread. Pick one single, solitary thing that, if you get it done, will make today not a complete write-off. This is your definite move. It doesn't have to be monumental.
"Answer that one dreaded email."
"Take out the recycling."
"Write one line of code."
Write it on a sticky note and put it on your monitor. This is now your main() function for the day. Everything else is a bonus.
Module 02: Signal Flow & Processing (The Mind)
Or, how to stop feedback loops from blowing the main speakers.
Managing Inputs (The Patch Bay): Your brain has a limited number of inputs. Every podcast, news alert, song, and conversation is a patch cable you're plugging in. If you plug everything in at once, all you get is white noise. Be the engineer. Unplug the shit that's just raising the noise floor. Curate your inputs to improve your signal-to-noise ratio.
The Mixing Desk (Emotional EQ): Emotions are just frequencies. Anxiety is a piercing high-frequency squeal. Depression is a muddy, undefined low-end rumble that swamps the whole mix. You can't just delete the track, but you can EQ it. Feeling anxious? Maybe cut those high frequencies with a low-pass filter (e.g., focused, repetitive work). Feeling that low-end mud? Try a high-pass filter (e.g., a brisk bike ride to get the heart rate up).
Dynamics Processing (The Rack): Your mind has a built-in effects rack.
Noise Gate: When you need to focus, apply a noise gate. Set the threshold to deliberately ignore low-level intrusive thoughts and minor distractions.
Compressor: When a feeling is too "peaky" and overwhelming, use a compressor. Breathing exercises are a classic compressor: they take the loud, sharp peaks of panic and reduce their amplitude, bringing them more in line with the rest of the signal.
Hard Limiter: For when shit is about to clip and distort your entire reality. This is the emergency off-switch. For you, this is splashing your face with cold water. It's a hard reset on the signal, preventing a total system overload.
Module 03: Hardware Maintenance (The Body)
You wouldn't run a server without proper cooling and a clean power supply, would you?
Power Supply (Fuel): Food isn't "good" or "bad." It's a power supply unit with different specs. Some meals are a clean, stable 80+ Gold PSU that will deliver consistent energy for hours. Others are a cheap, no-name fire hazard that causes voltage spikes and system instability (the sugar rush/crash). Garbage in, garbage out. Your code won't compile on a faulty power supply.
Defragmenting the Drive (Movement): Sitting still all day is like letting your file system get hopelessly fragmented. Data is scattered, access times are slow, and performance tanks. Movement—especially rhythmic stuff like cycling or longboarding—is the defrag command. It reorganizes the data, clears out corrupted temp files, and makes the whole system run smoother and faster.
Scheduled Downtime (Sleep & Rest): Sleep isn't "offline mode." It's when the system runs its most critical background tasks: clearing the RAM cache (memory consolidation), running antivirus scans (immune system), and installing critical updates (cellular repair). Skipping sleep is like clicking "remind me tomorrow" on a critical security patch for weeks on end. Eventually, you're gonna get a virus. Rest (meditation, staring at a wall, listening to an album) is not sleep; it's "low-power state," and it's just as important for preventing overheating.
Module 04: The Network Stack (Social Interaction)
How to interface with other nodes without constant packet loss.
The Firewall (Boundaries): Your personal energy and time are a private network. Not every connection request deserves to be accepted. A firewall isn't about blocking everything; it's about setting rules. "No, I don't have the bandwidth for that project." "I need some time to myself tonight." These aren't insults; they're firewall rules that prevent DDoS attacks on your own system resources.
The API (Communication): How you talk to people is your Application Programming Interface. A good API is well-documented (you say what you mean), consistent (you're reliable), and has clear error handling (you can apologize and fix things when you fuck up). A bad API is a confusing, undocumented mess that returns a 500 Internal Server Error every time someone tries to make a connection.
Packet Loss (Misunderstanding): When you're talking to someone and they're not getting it, you're experiencing packet loss. Don't just keep sending the same corrupted packet faster and louder. Try a different protocol. Re-transmit the data in a different format. Use an analogy. Draw a picture. Check if the receiver is even listening or if their port is closed.
Module 05: The DAW (Creative Workflow)
How to get from an empty project file to a final render.
The Sample Library (Capturing Ideas): Ideas are like rare audio samples. They appear randomly and vanish just as quickly. If you don't capture them, they're gone forever. Have a system. A notebook. A voice memo app. A text file. It doesn't matter what it is, but you need a sample library for thoughts. Your brain is for having ideas, not for holding them.
Arrangement View (Structuring Work): An empty project is terrifying. Don't try to write the whole track from start to finish. Start arranging blocks. This is the intro. This is the main loop. This is the breakdown. This is the //TODO: fix this later section. Work non-linearly. Get the main components down on the timeline, then worry about the transitions. The same goes for code, writing, or any project. Outline first, then fill in the details.
Mixing & Mastering (Finishing): The last 10% of a project takes 90% of the time. This is the mixing and mastering phase. It's also where perfectionism kills projects. A finished, rendered track that's 80% perfect is infinitely better than a 99% perfect project file that sits on your hard drive forever. Learn when to say "it's good enough." Bounce the track. Ship the code. Publish the post. git commit -m "final_mix_v1_final_final_for_real_this_time.wav" and move on.
Module 06: Version Control (Habits & Learning)
You are not your code, you are the programmer.
git commit (The Daily Log): End each day with a commit. Write one line in a log. Not a diary. Not "how you feel." A commit message. What did you ship? "Fixed the leaky faucet." "Wrote 10 lines of the script." "Finally answered that email." This creates a log of small wins that proves you're not just spinning your wheels. It's your commit history, and it's real.
Branching & Merging (Trying New Shit): Want to start a new habit or project? git checkout -b try-new-thing. This creates a safe, experimental branch. You can fuck around on this branch without breaking main (your stable, day-to-day life). If the new habit works out, git merge. If it's a disaster, just git branch -D try-new-thing. No drama. No "I failed." You just deleted a branch that didn't work. This is the ultimate ADHD productivity hack.
Bug Reports & Debugging (Learning from Failure): When you fuck up, you haven't had a moral failure; you've found a bug. Treat it like one. File a bug report. "Steps to reproduce: 1. Didn't sleep well. 2. Skipped breakfast. 3. Agreed to a last-minute meeting. Expected result: Productive meeting. Actual result: Got overwhelmed and snapped at a coworker." Now debug it. The bug isn't "I'm a bad person." The bug is in the code that let you agree to a meeting when system resources were already critical.
Refactoring (Optimization): Every now and then, look at your codebase—your routines, your workflows. Is there legacy code that's slowing you down? Are you doing things in a roundabout way because "that's how you've always done it"? Refactor. Optimize your functions. Make them cleaner, more efficient. This isn't about adding new features; it's about making the existing ones run better.
Module 07: The Root Directory (Spirituality & Meaning)
How to sudo your way into the core of your own OS.
Gaining Root Access (The sudo Command): Spirituality isn't an external program you install. It's the process of gaining privileged access to the system you're already running. It's the permission to read, write, and execute commands at the deepest level. This access isn't granted by a belief, but by turning your attention inward and observing the system's own source code.
Reading the System Logs (Meditation & Mindfulness): Meditation isn't about "clearing your mind." That's impossible. It's about running tail -f /var/log/consciousness.log. You're watching the endless stream of system processes, interrupts, and background daemons in real-time without terminating them. By observing the logs, you start to see the patterns, the recurring bugs, and the useless scripts that are eating up your CPU cycles. You stop identifying with the processes and start becoming the system administrator who observes them.
Connecting to the Mainframe (Flow & Awe): Those moments when you're so deep in a project—producing music, writing code, riding your longboard—that your sense of self dissolves? That's not a distraction; that's a high-bandwidth connection to the mainframe. It's a state of "flow." Similarly, moments of awe—staring at the night sky, listening to a breathtaking piece of music—are successful API calls to the universe. These connections remind you that your little laptop is part of a vast, interconnected network.
Running Garbage Collection (Letting Go): Your system is full of deprecated packages, old cache files, and memory leaks from past events (trauma, grudges, bad code). Spirituality is the act of running the garbage collector. It's the process of identifying what's no longer serving the system, acknowledging its past function, and releasing the memory it's occupying. This isn't a one-time script; it's a cron job you have to run regularly to maintain system health.

1. Passive IFF System (Hardware Skins & Tattoos)
Purpose: To function as a passive Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) transponder, acting as a social firewall to filter unauthenticated or incompatible network traffic ("normies"). It broadcasts a clear, non-verbal signal about your system's custom firmware, allowing other custom builds to recognize you and default configurations to self-select out.
Mechanism: By permanently altering the chassis's visual checksum, you create a non-verbal authentication layer. It saves significant processing power that would otherwise be spent on actively negotiating basic compatibility with every node on the network. It's a one-time hardware investment for a lifetime of passive social filtering.
